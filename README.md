MyOCR is a Python package designed to streamline the development of production-ready OCR systems. Engineers can easily train, customize, and deploy deep learning models into high-performance OCR pipelines for real-world applications.

## **üåü Key Features**:

**‚ö°Ô∏è End-to-End OCR Workflow** ‚Äì Seamlessly integrate detection, recognition, and various models.

**üõ†Ô∏è Modular & Extensible**‚Äì Mix and match components (swap models, processors, or input output converters).

**üöÄ Optimized for Production** ‚Äì ONNX runtime support for high-speed CPU/GPU inference.

**üìä Smart Structured Outputs** ‚Äì Convert raw OCR results into organized formats (e.g., invoices, forms).

**üîå Developer-Centric ‚Äì Clean** Python APIs, prebuilt pipelines, and easy custom training.

## üì£ Updates
- **üî•2025.04.24 release MyOCR alpha version**:
    - Release image detection, class, recognition models
    - All components can work together


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### üíª Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- CUDA 12.6+ (Recommended for GPU acceleration, but CPU mode is also supported)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è  Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/robbyzhaox/myocr.git
cd myocr

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Development environment installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Download pre-trained model weights

## ‚è≠Ô∏è  Quick Start

### üìù  Local Inference

#### Basic OCR Recognition

```python
from myocr.pipelines import CommonOCRPipeline

# Initialize common OCR pipeline (using GPU)
pipeline = CommonOCRPipeline("cuda:0")  # Use "cpu" for CPU mode

# Perform OCR recognition on an image
result = pipeline("path/to/your/image.jpg")
print(result)
```

#### Structured OCR Output (Example: Invoice Information Extraction)

config chat_bot in myocr.pipelines.config.structured_output_pipeline.yaml
```yaml
chat_bot:
  model: qwen2.5:14b
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
  api_key: 'key'
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from myocr.pipelines import StructuredOutputOCRPipeline

# Define output data model, refer to:
from myocr.pipelines.response_format import InvoiceModel

# Initialize structured OCR pipeline
pipeline = StructuredOutputOCRPipeline("cuda:0", InvoiceModel)

# Process image and get structured data
result = pipeline("path/to/invoice.jpg")
print(result.to_dict())
```

### üåê Using Rest API

The framework provides a simple Flask API service that can be called via HTTP interface:

```bash
# Start the service default port: 5000
python main.py 
```

API endpoints:
- `GET /ping`: Check if the service is running properly
- `POST /ocr`: Basic OCR recognition
- `POST /ocr-json`: Structured OCR output

We also have a UI for these endpoints, please refer to [doc-insight-ui](https://github.com/robbyzhaox/doc-insight-ui)


### üöó Docker Deployment

The framework provides support for Docker deployment, which can be built and run using the following commands:

#### Automated Build Script

The easiest way to build and run a Docker container is to use the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/build_docker_image.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/build_docker_image.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop and remove any existing MyOCR containers
- Clean up existing Docker images
- Copy models from your local configuration
- Build a new GPU-enabled Docker image
- Start a container with the service exposed on port 8000

#### Manual Docker Commands

If you need more control or customization:

```bash
# CPU version
docker build -f Dockerfile-infer-CPU -t myocr:cpu .

# GPU version
docker build -f Dockerfile-infer-GPU -t myocr:gpu .

# Run container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 myocr:gpu
```

## üéñ Contribution Guidelines

We welcome any form of contribution, including but not limited to:

- Submitting bug reports
- Adding new features
- Improving documentation
- Optimizing performance

### üì¶ Development Utilities

MyOCR includes several Makefile commands to help with development:

```bash
# Format code (runs isort, black, and ruff fix)
make run-format

# Run code quality checks (isort, black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
make run-checks

# Preview documentation in local
cd documentation
mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8001
```
