MyOCR is a highly extensible and customizable framework for building OCR systems. Engineers can easily train, integrate deep learning models into custom OCR pipelines for real-world applications.

Try the online [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/robbyzhaox/myocr)

## **üåü Key Features**:

**‚ö°Ô∏è End-to-End OCR Development Framework** ‚Äì Designed for developers to build and integrate detection, recognition, and custom OCR models in a unified and flexible pipeline.

**üõ†Ô∏è Modular & Extensible** ‚Äì Mix and match components - swap models, predictors, or input output processors with minimal changes.

**üîå Developer-Friendly by Design** - Clean Python APIs, prebuilt pipelines and processors, and straightforward customization for training and inference.

**üöÄ Production-Ready Performance** ‚Äì ONNX runtime support for fast CPU/GPU inference, support various ways of deployment.

## üì£ Updates
- **üî•2025.05.03 inner refactoring & update docs**
- **2025.04.28 release MyOCR alpha version**:
    - Release image detection, class, recognition models
    - All components can work together


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### üì¶ Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Optional: CUDA 12.6+ (Recommended for GPU acceleration, but CPU mode is also supported)

### üì•  Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/robbyzhaox/myocr.git
cd myocr

# create venv
uv venv

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Development environment installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Download pre-trained model weights
mkdir -p ~/.MyOCR/models/
Download weights from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RXppgx4XA_pBX9Ll4HFgWyhECh5JtHnY
# Alternative download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/122p9zqepWfbEmZPKqkzGBA?pwd=yq6j
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Inference

#### Basic OCR Recognition

```python
from myocr.pipelines import CommonOCRPipeline

# Initialize common OCR pipeline (using GPU)
pipeline = CommonOCRPipeline("cuda:0")  # Use "cpu" for CPU mode

# Perform OCR recognition on an image
result = pipeline("path/to/your/image.jpg")
print(result)
```

#### Structured OCR Output (Example: Invoice Information Extraction)

config chat_bot in myocr.pipelines.config.structured_output_pipeline.yaml
```yaml
chat_bot:
  model: qwen2.5:14b
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
  api_key: 'key'
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from myocr.pipelines import StructuredOutputOCRPipeline

# Define output data model, refer to:
from myocr.pipelines.response_format import InvoiceModel

# Initialize structured OCR pipeline
pipeline = StructuredOutputOCRPipeline("cuda:0", InvoiceModel)

# Process image and get structured data
result = pipeline("path/to/invoice.jpg")
print(result.to_dict())
```

### üê≥ Docker Deployment

The framework provides support for Docker deployment, which can be built and run using the following commands:

#### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 robbyzhaox/myocr:cpu-0.1.0
```

#### Accessing API Endpoints (Docker)

```bash
IMAGE_PATH="your_image.jpg"

BASE64_IMAGE=$(base64 -w 0 "$IMAGE_PATH")  # Linux
#BASE64_IMAGE=$(base64 -i "$IMAGE_PATH" | tr -d '\n') # macOS

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"image\": \"${BASE64_IMAGE}\"}" \
  http://localhost:8000/ocr

```

### üîó Using Rest API

The framework provides a simple Flask API service that can be called via HTTP interface:

```bash
# Start the service default port: 5000
python main.py 
```

API endpoints:
- `GET /ping`: Check if the service is running properly
- `POST /ocr`: Basic OCR recognition
- `POST /ocr-json`: Structured OCR output

We also have a UI for these endpoints, please refer to [doc-insight-ui](https://github.com/robbyzhaox/doc-insight-ui)
