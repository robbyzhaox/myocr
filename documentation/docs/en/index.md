**MyOCR is a highly extensible and customizable framework for streamline development and deployment of production-ready OCR systems.**

MyOCR makes it easy to train your custom models and seamlessly integrate them into your own OCR pipeline.

## Key Features

**‚ö°Ô∏è End-to-End OCR Development Framework** ‚Äì Designed for developers to build and integrate detection, recognition and custom OCR models in a unified and flexible pipeline.

**üõ†Ô∏è Modular & Extensible** ‚Äì Mix and match components - swap models, predictors, or input output processors with minimal changes.

**üîå Developer-Friendly by Design** - Clean Python APIs, prebuilt pipelines and processors, and straightforward customization for training and inference.

**üöÄ Production-Ready Performance** ‚Äì ONNX runtime support for fast CPU/GPU inference, support various ways of deployment.

## Getting Started

1.  **[Installation](./getting-started/installation.md):** Set up MyOCR and download necessary models.
2.  **[Overview](./getting-started/overview.md):** Understand the core concepts (Models, Predictors, Pipelines) for building your OCR capabilities.
3.  **[Inference Guide](./inference/local.md):** Learn how to run OCR tasks using MyOCR.

## Core Concepts

*   **[Models](./models/index.md):** Learn about the supported model types (ONNX, PyTorch, Custom) and architectures.
*   **[Predictors](./predictors/index.md):** Understand how models are wrapped with input/output processors to `Predictor`.
*   **[Pipelines](./pipelines/index.md):** Explore the high-level pipelines that orchestrate predictors for end-to-end OCR.

## Additional Resources

*   **[FAQ](./faq.md):** Find answers to common questions.
*   **[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md):** See recent updates and changes.
*   **[Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md):** Learn how to contribute to the project.
